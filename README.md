# 9key

The 9key macro keypad was created for use in the Electronics/Soldering Lab Certification at [Spark Makerspace](https://sparkmakerspace.org). Early discussions included the possibility of a series of increasingly complex iterations of the same board, adding more components and additional features with each step. This repo currently contains the first version of the first board. This README is technical/design documentation/notes. User-friendly assembly instructions will be hosted at [9k.spork.lol](https://9k.spork.lol).

Questions or concerns may be posed via an issue in this repo or by email at [electronics@sparkmakerspace.org](mailto:electronics@sparkmakerspace.org).

v1 Requirements:
* ~~Seeedstudio Xiao RP2040 as MCU~~
  * ~~Mounted on top of board so RGB LED is visible~~
  * ~~Instructions printed on board.~~
  * ~~Leave serial pin unused. Break to testpoint?~~
  * ~~Pinout for Xiao fully labeled on board.~~
  * ~~SMT 3.5mm jack for I2C SDA/SCL/GND (no power!!)~~
  * ~~Diodes and MCU **not stacked**.~~
  * ~~COL2ROW diode alignment.~~

## BOM
